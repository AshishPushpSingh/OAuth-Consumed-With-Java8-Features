This Application is an example of how OAuth can we consumed using Play Framework's WS web-client.

In this example we are exploring QuickBooks APIs which are protected by OAuth 1.0 authorization Flow.

QuickBooks is an accounting software package developed and marketed by Intuit. QuickBooks products are geared mainly
toward small and medium-sized businesses and offer on-premises accounting applications as well as cloud based versions
that accept business payments, manage and pay bills, and payroll functions.

Here we are exploring the Online version of the same.

In this application we are creating two REST endpoints:
GET     /qb                            controllers.HomeController.getDataFromQB()
GET     /auth                          controllers.HomeController.auth()

These endpoints are defined in conf/routes file.


The /auth endpoint takes you to the login screen of QuickBooks online as for authorization and for providing grant to
 the application.

The /qb endpoint hits the Invoice endpoint of Quickbooks and gets the list of invoices from the logged in account.


For keeping this Application simple I have created only one controller class and doing all the logic and operations
in the same class. You can (should as well) separate different functionality in different classes if you are developing
some application.
